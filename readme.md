# KnockoutJS Map Project

This is a KnockoutJS app that displays a list and map of tourist attractions in Orlando, FL, USA. The map and location markers are generated using the Google Maps API. When a location from the list is clicked, its map marker bounces and opens an infowindow populated with venue details and a photo from the Foursquare API.
